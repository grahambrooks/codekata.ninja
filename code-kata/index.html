                <p>It feels a bit trite to define code. For the purposes of a kata we are talking text that is
                    either interpreted or compiled into an executable and then run.</p>

                <h4>Kata</h4>

                <p>Kata (型 or 形 literally: "form"?) is a Japanese word describing detailed choreographed patterns of
                    movements practised either solo or in pairs. The term form is used for the corresponding concept
                    in non-Japanese martial arts in general. <cite>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata</cite></p>

                <p>Ninja in western culture and perhaps beyond has come to mean someone who is highly skilled. It is
                    also a really cool domain name.</p>

                <h4>Deliberate Practice</h4>

                <p>If practice makes perfect then performing code katas improves your code and coding skills. <a
                        href="http://codekata.com">http://codekata.com</a> has a good description of what a Code
                    Kata is and a list of Katas for you to try yourself.</p>

                <p>Katas can be done by yourself as a way to hone your skills in private or you can participate in a
                    Coding Dojo and use Code Katas in a group setting. Emily Bache has written a book all about
                    running a Dojo <a
                            href="http://www.amazon.com/Coding-Dojo-Handbook-Emily-Bache/dp/919811803X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1406314356&sr=1-1&keywords=coding+dojo">The
                        Coding Dojo Handbook</a> that you might find interesting.</p>

                <p>Performing Code Katas is about improvement. Like a musician or someone who plays sports its about
                    taking some element of the activity and practicing it in isolation to improve that one part. By
                    repeating these practice sessions your overall game improves. You might want to improve your TDD
                    skills, learn a new programming language or try different designs against the same problem. <a
                            href="http://refactoring.com">Refactoring</a> is about improving code design without
                    changing behaviour. You need tests to move with confidence but working on small programming
                    prolems (katas) you ability to spot refacotring opportunities improves.</p>

                <p>The problem domain often favours a particular programming style or language. Repeating a Kata
                    using different designs and languages helps you improve your ability to make better choices with
                    larger problems.</p>

                <h4>Time</h4>

                <p>Kata problems are designed to be short or can be split into chunks of time and performed over a
                    longer period or on differnt occasions. I typically budget about an hour which includes setup,
                    working on the problem and then reflecting on how I thought the exercise went. Don't skimp on
                    the reflection part. Take notes to review later, areas to work on next time. If you are pair
                    programming (highly recommenced) then discuss the problem with your partner.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-11">
                <h4>Tools</h4>

                <p>Choose tools that are either appropriate for the chosen language or that you want to learn. If
                    you are paring then make sure that the ground rules are agreed. Emacs/Vim debates are fun but
                    should not be part of the kata.</p>

                <p>Time taken setting up for practice can be a time sink. During my practice sessions I found myself
                    spending too much time setting up a basic project template and then switching back and forth
                    between editing and running my tests.</p>

                <p><a href="https://github.com/grahambrooks/codekata"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> codekata</a> is a
                    small set of shell scripts that speed up creating a basic project template. codekata can be
                    installed using <a href="http://brew.sh">homebrew</a></p>

                <p><a href="https://github.com/grahambrooks/lazybuilder"><i class="fa fa-github"></i>
                    lazybuilder</a> helps with the second problem. It waits for changes in the source tree and
                    triggers a build/test run of your code. codekata installs and runs lazybuilder.</p>

                <p>Both of these tools are OS X only at the moment. If you are interested in porting them to another
                    platform feel free to get in touch or send me a pull request.</p>
